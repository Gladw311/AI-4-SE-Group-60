        "Test automation, particularly with AI-powered tools like Testim.io, significantly enhances test coverage compared to manual methods. Manual testing is prone to human error and limited by time and resources, often resulting in incomplete coverage. AI addresses this by automating test case generation based on application analysis and user behavior, expanding coverage efficiently. Self-healing tests, a key AI feature, reduce maintenance effort by automatically adapting to UI changes, ensuring tests remain relevant and continue to provide coverage. AI also improves test stability and enables advanced techniques like visual testing for comprehensive UI coverage. By automating repetitive tasks and intelligently adapting to changes, AI allows testers to achieve broader and deeper test coverage, leading to higher confidence in the application's quality and stability.\n",
