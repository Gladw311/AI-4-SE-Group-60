# 🛠️ Mastering the AI Toolkit - AI Tools Assignment

Welcome to our repository for the **AI Tools and Applications Assignment** under the theme **"Mastering the AI Toolkit"**. This project showcases our theoretical understanding, practical skills, and ethical awareness in utilizing AI frameworks and tools.

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This assignment is structured into three key parts:

1. **Theoretical Understanding**
2. **Practical Implementation**
3. **Ethics and Optimization**

It aims to evaluate our proficiency in:
- Selecting and implementing appropriate AI tools (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, spaCy)
- Building and evaluating ML/DL models
- Reflecting on ethical implications and software optimization
